# Automating-PHd-Admission
>A web tool that assists universities and institutions, as well as applicants, in smoothly navigating the Ph.D. admission process. This process would have taken more manpower and resources a few years ago, but automating it saves both man-hours and resources while also improving the ease with which applicants and colleges conduct the process.

>From the applicant's perspective, our website provides a login page where the applicant can create an account and complete the rest of the application process. After creating an account, the candidate can look through all of the courses that are available and apply for one. After submitting an application, the applicant can check their status to see where they are in the process (assessment/interview/selected). The applicant will also be advised of any revisions to the course he or she has chosen, as well as the assessment links. Before a deadline, the applicant will be able to cancel the course he or she has applied for. He or she will be notified to upload the original certificates to complete the admission procedure after passing both rounds of examinations.

>Administrators from the university may be in charge of overseeing the entire admissions process. They will be given credentials to access a separate home page for administrative tasks. They will be able to upload new courses, complete with descriptions, deadlines, outcomes, eligibility requirements, and so on, as well as change material for previously published courses. The administrator will also have access to look at the number of people who applied. They can filter and view candidates based on numerous factors such as the course they applied for, their grades, and so on, and they can also blacklist any applicant based on their activity and information. The administrator can select the components for the assessment process and send notifications to current users. The administrator will also be allowed to choose which applications will go to the next phase of evaluation.
